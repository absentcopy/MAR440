Jay and I have brainstormed and come up with an idea to create a AR app. Within the application people will be able to have real-time interaction with the world around them as the system recognizes elements around you. These elements could be logos, text, landmarks, qr code, or anything else that has been created or logged by a user. The application will allow you to create handmade symbols with the touch screen as well, and attach these symbols to a comment user system. 

The systems backbone is image recognition, it will be populated by the user.

The application will be built for android devices in the java language, with the idea of moving to the ios system in the future.

We are building this application with the future in mind of AR & VR headsets. We would like this to be used in a Google Glasses or Mircosoft Hololens. Knowing that the hardware isn't in mainstream use we have decide to first make a proof of concept using phones.

Over the next 14 weeks, We would like to have a proof of concept running with real-time image recognition with user login.
