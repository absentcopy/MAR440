##AR Phone Application

Jay and I have brainstormed and come up with an idea to create a AR app. Within the application people will be able to have real time interaction with the world around them as the system recognizes elements around you. These elements could be logos, text, landmarks, qr code, or anything else that has been logged by a user.
